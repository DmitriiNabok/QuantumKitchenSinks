# Quantum Kitchen Sinks

Qiskit-based implementation of the original Quantum Kitchen Sinks (QKS) algorithm by Wilson et al. (2019).
As an extension, the library includes a variant of QKS, where the final circuit measurements are replaced with estimates of the expectation values of single qubits operators.

Application of QKS to the blobs dataset is provided in `qks-tests-blobs.ipynb`.
